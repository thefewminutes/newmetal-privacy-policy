  <h1>Privacy Policy for NewMetal PR Email Automation System</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> 03/18/2025</p>

  <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    NewMetal PR Email Automation System (“NewMetal,” “we,” “our,” or “us”) is committed to protecting the privacy and security of the information processed by our automated system. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, store, and safeguard information related to the processing of public PR emails and the generation of social media content on behalf of NewMetal.com.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Scope</h2>
  <p>
    This Privacy Policy applies solely to the NewMetal PR Email Automation System, which automates the ingestion, classification, and processing of public PR emails received for content generation purposes. It does not cover personal data collected by other NewMetal services or websites.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Information Collection</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>PR Email Content:</strong> We receive PR emails from external sources. These emails may include information such as band names, tour dates, release details, and links.</li>
    <li><strong>System Logs:</strong> Our system logs technical data (such as IP addresses, timestamps, and error logs) to monitor performance and ensure security.</li>
    <li><strong>Metadata:</strong> When processing emails, we extract metadata (such as email subject lines and sender information) solely for the purpose of content classification and generation.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Use of Information</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Content Generation:</strong> The email content is processed by our AWS-based system and the OpenAI API to classify and generate creative social media posts.</li>
    <li><strong>Data Storage:</strong> Emails are stored temporarily in an Amazon S3 bucket for processing purposes. Only the data required for generating the social media post is retained.</li>
    <li><strong>Automation and Posting:</strong> The generated content may be automatically published to NewMetal’s social media pages after an optional approval process.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. Data Storage and Retention</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Temporary Storage:</strong> Emails and processed content are stored in our Amazon S3 bucket and associated services (e.g., DynamoDB for draft storage) for as long as necessary to fulfill processing and auto-posting functions.</li>
    <li><strong>Log Retention:</strong> Technical logs are stored in AWS CloudWatch for troubleshooting and performance monitoring, in accordance with AWS best practices.</li>
    <li><strong>Deletion:</strong> We periodically review and delete data that is no longer necessary for our operations.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>6. Data Security</h2>
  <p>
    We employ industry-standard security measures to protect your data, including:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Secure storage on AWS with appropriate access controls.</li>
    <li>Encryption of data at rest and in transit.</li>
    <li>Regular audits of our systems and access logs to prevent unauthorized access.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>7. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Amazon Web Services (AWS):</strong> Our system relies on AWS services (SES, S3, Lambda, CloudWatch) for processing and storing data.</li>
    <li><strong>OpenAI API:</strong> The content generation and classification functions are provided by the OpenAI API. Data sent to OpenAI is used solely for processing and is subject to OpenAI’s privacy and security policies.</li>
    <li><strong>Facebook/Meta:</strong> If auto-publishing is enabled, our system interacts with Facebook’s Graph API to post content on NewMetal’s social media pages. We do not share personal data beyond what is required for this functionality.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>8. Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
  <p>
    We do not sell or rent your data. Information processed through the NewMetal PR Email Automation System is only used for generating content and may be shared with third-party service providers (such as AWS and OpenAI) strictly for operational purposes. We may also share aggregated, non-identifiable information for reporting and analysis.
  </p>

  <h2>9. International Data Transfers</h2>
  <p>
    Data processed by our system may be transferred and stored on servers located outside your country. We take appropriate measures to ensure data is protected in accordance with applicable laws.
  </p>

  <h2>10. Your Rights and Choices</h2>
  <p>
    Since our system primarily processes publicly available PR email content and technical data, there is minimal personal data involved. However, if you have any questions or concerns regarding your data, please contact us at privacy@newmetal.com.
  </p>

  <h2>11. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>
    We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted along with the updated effective date.
